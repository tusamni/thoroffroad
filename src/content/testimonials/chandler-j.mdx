title: Communication was on-point
name: Chandler J.
testimonial: THOR Off-Road did a fantastic job on my Stage 8 Icon install for my 3rd Gen Tacoma. With all the shipping delays occurring, the parts came in much faster than anticipated and communication was on-point. Install  was completed efficiently with everything tested, torqued, QC'd perfectly. Highly recommend these guys for any off-road auto needs.
