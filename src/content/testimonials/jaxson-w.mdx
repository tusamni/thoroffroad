title: Once again, did an amazing job
name: Jaxson W.
testimonial: The crew over at THOR Off Road once again did an amazing job. My 4Runner has been in the shop over the years and they always do a great job. This time they got me in quickly, spent a good amount of time helping me troubleshoot my issue, then booked a time to get the job done by fixing my front end popping noise.
