Now its time to add the personal touches that make your rig, <i>yours</i>!</p><p>Adding bumpers can serve many purposes and add style at the same time. Heavy duty Bumpers are designed to take impacts from foreign objects your factory bumper can't withstand. With bumpers from <span class=\"font-medium\">BodyGuard</span>, <span class=\"font-medium\">Ranch Hand</span>, <span class=\"font-medium\">ARB</span> and <span class=\"font-medium\">Renuel</span>, you'll never have to worry about making contact ever again.</p><p>If you're in need of clearance from uneven terrain and larger tires, we sell and install bumpers from <span class=\"font-medium\">Addictive Desert Design</span>, <span class=\"font-medium\">Nfab</span>, <span class=\"font-medium\">Fab Fours</span> and <span class=\"font-medium\">CBI</span>. Our bumpers also add functionality, like winches and additional lighting.</p><p>If you're utilizing a larger tire the fenders may need to be modified. THOR Off-Road can add fender flares of all sizes to accommodate tire size change, increase body protection and change the style of your truck. High clearance fender flares will allow for a much larger tire without having to add more lift. For extreme trucks, we offer extended fenders designed to widen the body of the vehicle allowing for full articulation.</p><p>With a tag line like <i>\"Purpose built\"</i> THOR Off-Road are here to help navigate all options and find what is right for you. <a href=\"/contact\" class=\"underline font-medium\">Let's start your build today</a>!</p>",
