description: GMC Sierra 1500 series trucks have been leading the way for generations. With tried-and-true power plants and great styling, THOR can help you build an exceptional off-road truck that can still get you to work on time. For off-road suspensions we use Baja Kits or RPG Offroad and for lift and leveling kits we look to BDS Suspensions to get your truck looking just right.
