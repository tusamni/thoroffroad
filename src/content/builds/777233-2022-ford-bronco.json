The Wildtrack Bronco provides such a great platform to modify. Here's what we did to make Jeremy's Bronco \"Badass\"! Starting with an RPG Suspension kit we were able to raise the Bronco 2.25\" and make room to Clear 37\" tires and provide full articulation.</p><p>Wrapping those BFG tires around a fully funtioning KMC beadlock provided ultimate versitily on and off the road. ADD Rock Fighter bumper front and rear. Baja Design lights in and on the bumper, on the roof and the spare tire mount. There is no lack of lighting to lead the way wherever this Bronco is headed.</p><p>This Bronco always has spectators surrounding it everywhere it goes!</p>",
