highlight: They gained me as a lifetime customer
testimonial: The guys at THOR Off-Road are top notch! They just installed my

  gained me as a lifetime customer.
goals: <p>The AEV Prospector XL is a Beast in a world of Beasts. When the owner
  of this RAM 2500 searched high and low to find an AEV Prospector XL only to
  realize these trucks don't come cheap. He then searched for a dealer to build
  the truck he wanted and found us here at THOR Off-Road. Being an AEV
  Authorized Dealer we were able to source all the parts to build out his Ram
  2500 to match the spec of the AEV he really wanted. </p><p>With the Dual Sport
  Suspension, High Mark Fenders, Bumper and 40" tires, this truck is a sight for
  sure. The intention was to get exactly what AEV inteded the truck to look and
  perform like but for a fraction of the cost of buying from a dealership. We
  see this truck roll through town all the time and it is quite the head
  turner.</p>
