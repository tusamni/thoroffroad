goals: <p>The AEV Prospector XL is a Beast in a world of Beasts. The owner of
    this RAM 2500 searched high and low to find an AEV Prospector XL only to
    realize these trucks don't come cheap. He then searched for a dealer to build
    the truck he wanted and found us here at THOR Off-Road. Being an AEV
    Authorized Dealer we were able to source all the parts to build out his RAM
    2500 to match the spec of the AEV he really wanted.</p><p>With the Dual Sport
    Suspension, High Mark Fenders, Bumper and 40" tires, this truck is a sight.
    The intention was to get exactly what AEV intended but for a fraction of the
    cost. We see this truck roll through town all the time and it is quite the
    head turner.</p>
