goals: <p>The AEV Prospector XL is a Beast in a world of Beasts. When the owner of this RAM 2500 searched out high and low to find an AEV Prospector XL he realized these trucks don't come cheap. He then searched for a dealer to build the truck he wanted and found us here at THOR Off-Road.</p><p>Being an AEV Authorized Dealer we were able to source all the parts to build out his RAM 2500 to match the spec of the AEV he really wanted. With the Dual Sport Suspension, High Mark Fenders, Bumper and 40" tires, well this truck is a sight for sure.</p><p>The intention was to get exactly what AEV intended, but for far less than the cost of buying one from a dealership. We see this truck roll through town all the time and it is quite the head turner!
