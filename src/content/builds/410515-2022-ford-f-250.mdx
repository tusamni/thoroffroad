goals: <p>Beefy, functional and unique is what the customer asked for and
  exactly what we delivered!</p><p>Sometimes it's hard to pick the right parts
  in a sea of options. Mark J. looked to us to make his Super Duty F-250 unique
  and funtional.</p><p>After hearing others refer him to us for our popular
  Carli Suspension systems, he then needed our help picking the right bumpers,
  wheels and options so this truck does exactly what he needed. The 5.5"
  Backcountry System offered him the look he wanted and plush ride he desired.
  Matched with bumpers and lights from Fab Fours and Rigid this truck has a very
  demanding presense and all the functionality anyone could possibly want from a
  Super Duty.</p>
