goals: "Beefy, Functional and Unique!!  These were exactly what the Customer
    wanted and exactly what we delivered.  Sometimes its hard to pick the right
    parts in a sea of options out there.  Mark Jones looked to us to make his
    Super Duty F250 unique and Funtional.  After hearing others refer him to us
    for the popular Carli Suspension suspension systems, He then needed our help
    picking the right bumpers wheels and options so this truck does exactly what
    he needed.  The 5.5 Backcountry System offered him the look he wanted and
    plush ride he desired.  Matched with bumpers and lights from Fab Fours and
    Rigid this truck has very demanding precense and all the functionality anyone
    could possibly want out of a Super Duty.  "
