    highlight: Another shop used incorrect parts
    content: The team at THOR Off Road helped me get my Carli Suspension system completed and corrected after another shop used some incorrect parts and installation methods. They were very easy to communicate with and get a hold of and willing to answer any and all questions I had. I'd highly recommend them!
