goals: <p>After seeing a Badlands Bronco built for this customer's daughter, he
  handed us the keys and said "Have Fun!" That is exactly what we did. The
  Wildtrack Bronco provides such a great platform to modify. Here's what we did
  to make Jeremy's Bronco "Badass"! Starting with an RPG Suspension kit we were
  able to raise the Bronco 2.25" and make room to Clear 37" tires and provide
  full articulation.</p><p>Wrapping those BFG tires around a fully funtioning
  KMC beadlock provided ultimate versitily on and off the road. ADD Rock Fighter
  bumper front and rear. Baja Design lights in and on the bumper, on the roof
  and the spare tire mount. There is no lack of lighting to lead the way
  wherever this Bronco is headed.</p><p>This Bronco always has spectators
  surrounding it everywhere it goes!</p>
