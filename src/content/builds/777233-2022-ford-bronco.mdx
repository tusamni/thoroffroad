goals: <p>After seeing what we built for this Customers daughter on her Badlands
  Bronco, he handed us the keys and said "Have Fun!"  That is exactly what we
  did.  The Wildtrack Bronco provides such a great platform to modify and here
  is what we did to make what Jeremy asked us to do and make it
  "Badass!"  Starting with a RPG Suspension kit we were able to raise the Bronco
  2.25" and make room to Clear 37" tires and provide full
  articulation.</p><p>Wrapping those BFG tires around a fully funtioning KMC
  beadlock provided ultimate versitily on and off the road. ADD Rock Fighter
  bumper front and rear. Baja Design lights in the bumper, on the bumper, Roof
  mounted and rear mounted there is no lack of lighting to lead the way wherever
  this Bronco is headed.</p><p>This bronco always has spectators surrounding it
  everywhere he goes!!</p>
