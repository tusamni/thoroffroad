    "<p>“THOR Off-Road did a fantastic job on my Stage 8 Icon install for 3rd Gen Tacoma. With all the shipping delays occurring, the parts came in much faster than anticipated and communication was on-point. Install was completed efficiently with everything tested, torqued, QC'd perfectly.</p><p>Highly recommend these guys for any off-road auto needs.”</p>",
    "<p>Seamless transaction when I went to Thor, Personnel were extremely knowledgable and very friendly.</p>",
    "<p>The team at Thor helped me get my Carli Suspension system completed and corrected after another shop used some incorrect parts and installation methods. They were very easy to communicate with and get a hold of and willing to answer any and all questions I had.</p>",
    "<p>I was traveling across the country and had a major issue and included a brake line blowing and nobody in Austin could help me. I rolled in early here and even though they were super busy and these guys did an amazing job of taking care of me.</p>",
    "<p>I knew I wanted a Carli suspension system when I bought my truck and was pleasantly surprised to find out I lived down the road from Texas' only Carli stocking dealer in THOR Off Road. It was immediately evident from the moment I walked in the shop that they were as excited to help design my upgrades as I was and that made the process so enjoyable.</p>",
    "<p>Well-oiled machine. The guys at Thor do a great job from quoting, scheduling, completing the job on-time and on budget, and getting me out of there. This is the second time I've had work done to my truck. The first time was installing a Ranch Hand grill guard, this time a larger fuel tank.</p>",
    "<p>The guys at Thor are top notch! They just installed my fully optioned Carli 3.25 Pintop on my Cummins and I can't be happier. They gained me as a lifetime costumer.</p>",
    "<p>Thor recently installed a lift/level kit on my 2020 Jeep Gladiator. The work was top notch, done on time as promised, and at a reasonable price. Am very pleased and already working with them to perform upgrade suspension work on another 4x4!</p>",
    "<p>THOR Off Road has the best staff I have ever encountered at an off road shop! They are all very professional, knowledgeable and polite.</p>",
