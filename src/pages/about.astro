							It all started when I was a kid. My dad owned a brake shop, and I ran around the shop, playing with parts, learning how to balance tires and mop floors. Growing up, I had a passion for making things better. I started
							creating purpose built vehicles, mostly around hunting and ranch trucks. We quickly realized there was there was a niche for purpose built vehicles.

							THOR Off-Road takes the time to listen to the customer's needs. We put a personal touch on every truck and make sure that we're getting them exactly what they're looking for. Every customer who comes into THOR Off-Road
							wants something different. No matter your budget, you'll get world class service.
